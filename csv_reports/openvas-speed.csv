  form of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) that relies on the use of publicly accessible open
  recursive DNS servers to overwhelm a victim system with DNS response traffic.

  The basic attack technique consists of an attacker sending a DNS name lookup request to an open
  recursive DNS server with the source address spoofed to be the victim's address. When the DNS
  server sends the DNS record response, it is sent instead to the victim. Attackers will typically
  submit a request for as much zone information as possible to maximize the amplification effect.
  Because the size of the response is typically considerably larger than the request, the attacker
  is able to amplify the volume of traffic directed at the victim. By leveraging a botnet to perform
  additional spoofed DNS queries, an attacker can produce an overwhelming amount of traffic with
  little effort. Additionally, because the responses are legitimate data coming from valid servers,
  it is especially difficult to block these types of attacks.

  - Mode 6 Information Disclosure:

  Mode 6 queries can often be used to obtain system information such as system and kernel versions.

  - Mode 6 Amplification Attacks:

  An Amplification attack is a popular form of DDoS that relies on the use of publicly accessible
  NTP services to overwhelm a victim system with response traffic.

  The basic attack technique consists of an attacker sending a valid query request to a NTP service
  with the source address spoofed to be the victim's address. When the Memcached server sends the
  response, it is sent instead to the victim. Attackers will typically first inserting records into
  the open server to maximize the amplification effect. Because the size of the response is
  typically considerably larger than the request, the attacker is able to amplify the volume of
  traffic directed at the victim. By leveraging a botnet to perform additional spoofed queries, an
  attacker can produce an overwhelming amount of traffic with little effort. Additionally, because
  the responses are legitimate data coming from valid clients, it is especially difficult to block
  these types of attacks.","Checks if the remote NTP service has responded to NTP Mode 6

  responding to Mode 6 queries it can participate in an Amplification-based DDoS attack or could
  disclose sensitive system information.

  - Mode 6 Information Disclosure:

  Mode 6 queries can often be used to obtain system information such as system and kernel versions.

  - Mode 6 Amplification Attacks:

  An Amplification attack is a popular form of DDoS that relies on the use of publicly accessible
  NTP services to overwhelm a victim system with response traffic.

  The basic attack technique consists of an attacker sending a valid query request to a NTP service
  with the source address spoofed to be the victim's address. When the Memcached server sends the
  response, it is sent instead to the victim. Attackers will typically first inserting records into
  the open server to maximize the amplification effect. Because the size of the response is
  typically considerably larger than the request, the attacker is able to amplify the volume of
  traffic directed at the victim. By leveraging a botnet to perform additional spoofed queries, an
  attacker can produce an overwhelming amount of traffic with little effort. Additionally, because
  the responses are legitimate data coming from valid clients, it is especially difficult to block
  these types of attacks.","Checks if the remote NTP service has responded to NTP Mode 6
  Queries.

  provider, etc. they use. Especially if this is confirmed (snooped) multiple times over a period.

  the DNS server's owner typically access his net bank etc. The cached DNS record's remaining TTL
  value can provide very accurate data for this.

  form of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) that relies on the use of publicly accessible open
  recursive DNS servers to overwhelm a victim system with DNS response traffic.

  The basic attack technique consists of an attacker sending a DNS name lookup request to an open
  recursive DNS server with the source address spoofed to be the victim's address. When the DNS
  server sends the DNS record response, it is sent instead to the victim. Attackers will typically
  submit a request for as much zone information as possible to maximize the amplification effect.
  Because the size of the response is typically considerably larger than the request, the attacker
  is able to amplify the volume of traffic directed at the victim. By leveraging a botnet to perform
  additional spoofed DNS queries, an attacker can produce an overwhelming amount of traffic with
  little effort. Additionally, because the responses are legitimate data coming from valid servers,
  it is especially difficult to block these types of attacks.

  Note: This finding might be an acceptable risk if you:

  - trust all clients which can reach the server

  - do not allow recursive queries from outside your trusted client network","Sends a crafted UDP based DNS request and checks the response.

Generic web application scanning is disabled for this host via the ""Enable generic web application scanning"" option within the ""Global variable settings"" of the scan config in use.

Requests to this service are done via HTTP/1.1.

This service seems to be able to host PHP scripts.

This service seems to be NOT able to host ASP scripts.

The User-Agent ""Mozilla/5.0 [en] (X11, U; OpenVAS-VT 23.4.1)"" was used to access the remote host.

Historic /scripts and /cgi-bin are not added to the directories used for CGI scanning. You can enable this again with the ""Add historic /scripts and /cgi-bin to directories for CGI scanning"" option within the ""Global variable settings"" of the scan config in use.

The following directories were used for CGI scanning:

http://150.164.203.15:5514/

While this is not, in and of itself, a bug, you should manually inspect these directories to ensure that they are in compliance with company security standards

  - it doesn't response in a reasonable amount of time to various HTTP requests sent by this VT.
