# openvas_agent

This repository have a goal of make a plan for integration of an AI with the OpenVAS API, aiming to eventually develop a copilot capable of assisting users in vulnerability analysis and result interpretation. The idea is that the tool could automate tasks such as prioritizing alerts, suggesting remediations based on best practices, and providing detailed explanations. This planning will consider challenges such as secure authentication, user-friendly response formatting, and the possibility of customizing the experience for specific user scenarios.
