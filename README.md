# OpenVAS Agent: Your AI-Powered Vulnerability Analysis Copilot

![OpenVAS Agent Logo](openvasagent.png)

Welcome to the OpenVAS Agent project! This tool leverages the power of AI to revolutionize how you interact with the OpenVAS vulnerability scanner. Our goal is to create a powerful, intuitive copilot that assists you in analyzing vulnerabilities, interpreting results, and streamlining your security workflow.

## üöÄ Features

*   **AI-Powered Vulnerability Analysis:** Go beyond simple scans. The agent helps you understand the real-world impact of vulnerabilities.
*   **Intelligent Prioritization:** Automatically prioritize alerts based on severity, exploitability, and asset criticality.
*   **Actionable Remediation:** Receive best-practice remediation suggestions tailored to your specific environment.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Interact with OpenVAS through a simple, conversational interface.
*   **Customizable Workflows:** Adapt the agent to your unique security needs and scenarios.

## üîß Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

*   An operational OpenVAS/Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) instance.
*   Python 3.8 or higher.
*   Access to the GVM API.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/raphaelalvesdev/CEIA_OpenVAS_Agent
    cd CEIA_OpenVAS_Agent
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure your environment:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following the informations of `ENV.md`

### Permissions

To allow the agent to connect to the `gvmd.sock` for API requests, you may need to adjust its permissions:

```bash
sudo chmod 660 /run/gvmd/gvmd.sock
```

If you still encounter issues, you can try a more permissive setting (use with caution):

```bash
sudo chmod 777 /run/gvmd/gvmd.sock
```

### Running the Agent

Launch the OpenVAS Agent with the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
